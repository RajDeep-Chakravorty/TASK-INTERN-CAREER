## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring and analyzing the top YouTube content creators. The dataset includes valuable information such as ranking, categories, subscribers, country, visits, likes, comments, and more for the top 1000 YouTube streamers.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis is structured into several key steps:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Check for missing data and outliers.
   - Visualize missing values using a heatmap.

3. **Identify Outliers:**
   - Box plots are used to identify outliers, assuming 'subscribers' is a relevant column.

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Identify trends among the top YouTube streamers.
   - Explore popular categories and correlations between subscribers, likes, and comments.

5. **Performance Metrics Analysis:**
   - Calculate and visualize the average number of subscribers, visits, likes, and comments.
   - Explore patterns or anomalies in these metrics.

6. **Content Categories Analysis:**
   - Explore the distribution of content categories and identify categories with the highest number of streamers.
   - Analyze performance metrics for specific categories.
   - Analyze whether streamers with high performance metrics receive more brand collaborations and marketing campaigns.

8. **Audience Study:**
   - Analyze the distribution of streamers' audiences by country and identify regional preferences for specific content categories.

9. **Performance Metrics and Recommendations:**
   - Propose a system for enhancing content recommendations based on streamers' categories and performance metrics.

  - Create time-series visualizations (line charts, area charts) to show trends in the number of terrorist attacks over years or months.

- **Mapping Attack Locations:**
  - Use map visuals to plot attack locations geographically, providing insights into hotspots and affected regions.

- **Analysis of Attack Types and Weapons Used:**
  - Visualize trends in attack types (bombings, armed assaults, etc.) and weapons used (explosives, firearms) using bar charts or pie charts.

- **Comparing Casualties:**
  - Compare casualties (deaths, injuries) by region or year using stacked bar charts or area charts to highlight impact differences over time.

## 3. Interactive Dashboard

### Building an Interactive Experience
- **Dashboard Components:**
  - Incorporate slicers, filters, and drill-through options to allow users to dynamically explore the data.
  - Ensure interactivity for selecting time periods, regions, and specific attributes.
